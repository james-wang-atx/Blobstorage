          "I had the same problem with an 1.9.7 app.
           Go to appengine.google.com,
           <Select your project in left panel, then...>
           [in left panel] go to Administration-> Application Settings.
           Scroll to the bottom of the page, Cloud Integration and enable it (click Create).
           After a while you should see the Google Cloud Storage Bucket, in the [end of] "Basics" area in the same page.
           
           The above instructions is basically saying same as what is described here:
                https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/php/googlestorage/setup
                
           "For apps created after the App Engine 1.9.0 release, the default GCS bucket is automatically created with your app.
            For apps created before the App Engine 1.9.0 release, you can obtain a default bucket for it by clicking Create 
            within the Cloud Integration section in the Application Settings page of the App Engine Admin Console."

           The blobstore app was originally deployed with previous appengine sdk 1.8.8, so even though I redeployed
           with 1.9.7, it probably didn't change any of the initial application settings.
           
           Finally, I don't know where the equivalent setting is in the new console.developers.google.com page vs.
           the old appengine.google.com page.  However, in the new page, the default gcs bucket does show up in
           Storage...>Cloud Storage...>Storage Browser
           The enabling of 'Cloud Integration' in the old settings page probably relates to API enablement in the
           new settings page, but not sure...

  <!--
    HTTP Sessions are disabled by default. To enable HTTP sessions specify:

      <sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>

    It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to
    asynchronously write HTTP session data to the datastore:

      <async-session-persistence enabled="true" />

    With this feature enabled, there is a very small chance your app will see
    stale session data. For details, see
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig.html#Enabling_Sessions
